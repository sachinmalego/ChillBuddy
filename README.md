# ChillBuddy
A GPT-Based AI Chatbot for Mental Health Support

## Overview
**ChillBuddy** is a research project that introduces a GPT-based AI chatbot designed to provide mental health support using emotion-aware, empathetic, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. This chatbot is specifically fine-tuned for Generation Z, ensuring engagement through relatable language and digital communication preferences.

## Document Structure
This document provides a comprehensive research study, structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Background on the increasing need for mental health support, challenges faced by Generation Z, and the role of AI-driven chatbots in addressing these issues.
2. **Related Work**: A review of previous studies on emotion detection, sentiment analysis, CBT in AI, and persuasive conversations in chatbots.
3. **Methodology**: Details on the chatbot’s architecture, dataset collection, data preprocessing, and training process.
4. **Tasks and Models**: Explanation of the chatbot’s reasoning model, fine-tuning strategy, and self-consistency mechanisms.
5. **Evaluation and Metrics**: Approach for assessing chatbot performance, including benchmarking against therapist responses and automated GPT-4 evaluations.
6. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summary of findings and potential improvements for future iterations.

## Key Features
- **Emotion-Aware AI**: Detects user emotions and adjusts responses accordingly.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Integration**: Provides structured, evidence-based psychological support.
- **Generation Z Linguistic Adaptation**: Uses fine-tuned models to incorporate Gen Z’s tone, slang, and digital communication style.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Employs a reward model to optimize responses for empathy and coherence.
- **Ethical AI & Compliance**: Adheres to GDPR and ethical AI principles in mental health applications.

## Dataset Sources
The chatbot is trained using a variety of datasets, including:
- **Mental Health FAQ for Chatbot** (Kaggle)
- **Mental Disorder Dataset** (Hugging Face)
- **Gen Z Linguistic Dataset** (Hugging Face)
- **High-Quality Therapy Conversations** (Counsel Chat, Psych8k)

## Installation and Usage
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Flask (for chatbot deployment)

### Running the Chatbot
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chillbuddy.git
   cd chillbuddy
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the chatbot API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the chatbot via a chat interface (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.).

## Evaluation Metrics
The chatbot is evaluated based on:
- **Empathy & Coherence** (GPT-4-based automated evaluation)
- **CBT Adherence** (Comparison with therapist responses)
- **User Engagement & Satisfaction** (Survey-based analysis)
